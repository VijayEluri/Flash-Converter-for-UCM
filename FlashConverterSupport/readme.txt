The Flash Converter Support supports streaming content converted by the FlashConverter component.  This component is entirely optional if a streaming server is not installed.
The following actions will be required post installation.
1.	 Set the physical path for the streaming server using the FlashMediaPhysicalRoot in the environmental.cfg file.
2.	Set the URL root for the streaming server in the FlashMediaUrlRoot entry also found in the environmental.cfg file.
